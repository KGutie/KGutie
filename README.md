- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KGutie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... learning the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently retaking a HTML/CSS course in Scrimba to pick up on new information and tips to make cleaner code and understand how things work better, and I'll then jump into JS and Python.
- I want to build a product site for Kayaking as my first big project.
