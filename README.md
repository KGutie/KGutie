- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristy, I'm a creative marketer and program manager. I love solving problems and really love the way code feels a bit like magic and art. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... learning the basics of Javascript and Python. I want to understand the fullstack approach so I can build an app. I'm also interested in Vibe Coding to combine knowledge from coding with AI prompting to build tools and eventually, my own app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currentlytaking courses in Scrimba to pick up on new information and tips to make cleaner code, and I'll then jump into JS and Python.
