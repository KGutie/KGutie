- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KGutie I'm a creative marketer. I love solving problems and really love the way code feels a bit like magic and art. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... learning the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently retaking a HTML/CSS course in Scrimba to pick up on new information and tips to make cleaner code and understand how things work better, and I'll then jump into JS and Python.
