- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristy, I'm a creative marketer and program manager. I love solving problems and really love the way code feels a bit like magic and art. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... learning the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently playing with HTML/CSS and taking courses in Scrimba to pick up on new information and tips to make cleaner code, and I'll then jump into JS and Python.
